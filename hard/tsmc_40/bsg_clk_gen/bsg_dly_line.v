// bsg_delay_line
//
// new settings are delivered via bsg_tag_i
//
// the clock is designed to be atomically updated
// between any of its values without glitching.
//
// the order of components is:
//
// ADT, CDT, FDT  --> feedback (and buffer to outside world)
//
// All three stages invert their outputs.
//
// All of the modules have delay circuits that clock their config
// flops right after the signal has passed through. All of them are
// configured to grab the new value after a negedge enters the beginning of
// of the ADT, but of course since the signal is inverted at each stage
// ADT and FDT do it on posege and CDT does it on negedge.
//
// We employ a MUXI4 that is part of the standard cell library
// that we verify to be glitch-free using spice simulation (presumably because it is based on a
// t-gate design). If the MUXI4 were made out of AND-OR circuits, care
// would have to be taken to make sure that the transitions occur when
// either all inputs are 0 or 1 to the MUXI4, depending on the implementation.
// For example, if the mux is AOI, triggered on negedge edge of input clock would
// be okay. Fortunately, we don't have to worry about this (and confirmed by spice.)
//
// We have verified this in TSMC 40 by running with sdf annotations.
//

// Gen 2 specific info (starting with 40nm)  MBT 5-26-2018
//
// This Gen 2 clock generator has been slight redesigned in order to address the races
// in the gen 1 design that prevented automation.
//
// We use the bsg_tag_client_unsync implementation in order to reduce the load on
// the internally generated clock. Additionally, we separate out the we_r trigger
// signal so that it is explicitly set. This means that to set the frequency
// on average, three packets will need to be sent. First, a packet will be sent
// to set clock configuration bits. Then a packet will be sent to enable the we_r
// signal. Finally a packet will be sent to clear the we_r signal.
// This applies only for the oscillator programming.
//
// The trigger is synchronized inside the ADT; and then the synchronized signal
// is buffered and passed on to the CDT and then to the FDT, mirroring the
// flow of the clock signal through the units.
//
// The goal of this approach is to ensure that a new value is latched into the
// oscillator's configuration registers atomically, and during the first negative
// clock phase after a positive edge.
//
//
// The downsampler uses the normal interface.
//
//
// Gen 1 specific info (for reference)
//
// There is an implicit race between the bsg_tag's output fb_we_r (clocked on
// positive edge of FDT output) and these config flops that cannot be addressed
// in ICC because we cannot explicitly control timing between ICC-managed
// clocks and our internal oscillator clocks.
//
// A final check must be made on the 5 flops inside the adt / cdt / fdt
// to see that async reset drops and data inputs do not come too close
// to the appropriate clock edge.  This could be verified via a script that
// processes the SDF file, but for now we pull the test trace up in DVE and
// manually check these points.  Typically, the ADT is the closest
// call, where in MAX timing mode, the data changes about 481 ps before the
// positive edge of the flop's clock. With a setup time on the order of
// 261 ps, there is a slack of 220 ps. This path was originally a problem
// and it fixed by sending the clock out to the BTC at the beginning of
// the FDT as opposed to at the end. This gives more time for propagate
// through the ICC-generate clock tree for the BTC.
//
