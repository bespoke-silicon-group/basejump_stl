Testbench:

- Set design parameters for design like bits/iteration and design width in the make command
UNSIGN - Test unsigned (default don't test)
SIGN - Test signed (default don't test)
WIDTH - design width
BITS_PER_ITER - 1 or 2 bits per iteration generated (different hardware designs)
ITERS - Number of simulation iterations (inputs tested)

- Test_bsg.v gets inputs from get_stim function from get_stim.c

- get_stim retrieves inputs from the stimulus file specified in get_stim.c line 40.
Inputs are retrieved from the stimulus file until the end of the file is reached.
After which point, inputs are generated randomly for the remaining number of iterations
in the simulation (specified at the top of test_bsg.v)

- An exhaustive stimulus file containing all possible inputs is provided in divide_4.stim
A stimulus file testing a few edge cases for 32 and 64 bit designs is provided in
divide_32.stim and divide_64.stim. Random test cases will be tested for iterations of
the simulation after the iteration matching the length of the file.

- unsigned.c and signed.c read in files u.txt and s.txt generated by running the sim
and containing the inputs tested in the sim. They produce a text file of the expected
outputs for signed and unsigned division of the inputs.

- Different widths can be specified as parameters in the simulation (test_bsg.v) and
the generation of expected outputs (signed.c and unsigned.c)

- Use make vcs to run the simulation

- Use make verify to compare the differences in the outputs generated by the simulation
(u_output.txt and s_output.txt) and the expected outputs (u_expected.txt and
s_expected.txt)
