// bsg_fifo_1r1w_large
//
// This implementation is specifically
// intended for processes where 1RW rams
// are much cheaper than 1R1W rams, like
// most ASIC processes, or where 1R1W rams
// are not available.
//
// The idea is that a 1R1W ram is often 1.7X
// or more of the size of a 1RW, so we can
// save area.
//
// There are five+ possible implementations
// of a FIFO using 1RW rams:
//
// a. (bsg_fifo_1r1w_small) synthesize 1R1W RF from DFFs. Area per bit
//    of storage is often 10x larger than 1RW SRAM. But the SRAM
//    needs a sense-amp for every bit that is accessed per cycle, which is
//    about the size of 7 DFF-bits. So, for instance, if you need
//    to access 64 bits per cycle, then that incurs ~450 DFF bits of overhead,
//    so the DFF-RF will be cheaper up until to 512 bits. If you only need
//    to access 32 bits in parallel, then the breakeven would be closer to 256 bits.
//
// b. Use a true 1R1W ram; about 2X larger than 1RW SRAM. Maybe available for FPGA
//    but often not available, or not a good deal for ASIC.
//
// c. (not implemented) To get more ports, use two rams of half size, and then round
//    robin odd/even elements. We can favor the
//    writer, and then use a two-element fifo
//    with bypass after each 1RW, and select between
//    the two. Net cost is 4 words of DFF plus two 1RW SRAMs of size 1/2 but same width.
//    A draft of this code is at the end of this file, but it is incomplete/untested Caveat emptor.
//
// d. (bsg_fifo_1r1w_large) To get "more ports", use a single 1RW of double width
//    and read/write two elements at a time, as described in this module.
//    The cost is 7 DFF elements for staging plus 1 RW of double width and half words. So for
//    a 64-bit wide ram, the overhead is almost 3*450 = 1400 DFF bits; slightly more than
//    case c), but since there is only one RAM there are savings.
//
//    A single 1RW versus two 1RW's can be a win, but not always. The RAM
//    is larger, so there is potential for there is to be more amortization of
//    overhead. But on the other hand, # of sense amps is the same, so some of the
//    overheads are the same. One problem with this design for smaller RAMs is 
//    that it doubles the number of sense amps in a single ram, which can make
//    the aspect ratio undesirable or even impossible.
//
// e. (bsg_fifo_1r1w_pseudo_large) Use a pseudo 1RW fifo, where it looks like it is 1r1w, but actually
//    it is a 1RW that favors writes. Unlike "large", it has the same bandwidth, so we save space
//    on sense amps. This only applies when you know data is coming in at 1/2 rate or slower.
//
// Generally speaking, an SRAM's area is proportional to the number of bits, the number of
// sense amps, and the amount of decoder. If we take a wide ram and break it into two rams
// of half the width, but the same total bits, we have the same number of total bits and
// the same number of sense amps, but more decoder area, so there is a slight increase. 
//
// The 7 elements overhead coud potentially be significant,
// since they are implemented with ordinary flops, probably 4X per bit versus the
// So we have an equation,  area improvement = 1.7 W / (W + 4*7);
//
//       64 --> 20% (probably less than this)
//      128 --> 40%
//      256 --> 53%
//      512 --> 62%

//
// Rather than use two 1RW and alternate
// between them, we use one 1RW of double
// width. This saves area especially for
// medium size fifos (e.g. 64x64 = 4096 bits).
//
// Since data is bunched in pairs, we create
// a free slot from which we can fetch data from
// the big fifo every other cycle.

// When there is little data in the FIFO
// data is round robin dispatched to a pair of
// two element fifos (little fifos). If the
// little fifos fill up, then the data is bunched up into
// pairs and written into a double width single
// ported 1RW FIFO (big fifos). Priority is given to
// writing to the big fifos; except if the little fifo
// only has two elements left; then reads are given
// priority so that the data arrives in time.
//
// This policies allows us to guarantee the invariants of
// a FIFO: it will never say it's full if it has less than
// N elements in it; and it will never say it's empty
// if it has more than 0 elements in it. This is not
// that straightforward with this kind of fifo because
// the data could actually be in three different places:
// the buncher, the little FIFO, and the big FIFO.
//
// Note that the FIFO does not guarantee an upper bound
// on how many elements it will accept. This may actually
// be as high as N+4+3.
