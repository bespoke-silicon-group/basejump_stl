# Lines begin with '#', newline, or white spaces are ignored.

# A valid line has the following format:
# r  <id>  <branch>
# c  <id>  <branch>  <name>  <data_bits>  <default>

# For a relay node
# r indicates it is a relay node
# <id> is a unique decimal integer associated with a node. It *MUST* be consecutive integers starting from 0.
#      This id is only meaningful for automatic testbench generation.
#      A relay node does not require an id to work properly.
# <branch> is another relay node id indicating to which this new relay node is connected to.
#          if 'x' is put in this position, a random relay node is seleted as a branch.
#          This branch id is only meaningful for automatic testbench generation.
#          A relay node does not require a branch id to work properly.

# If no relay node is explicitly provided (i.e. no line begin with 'r'), a random
# number of relay nodes will be generated and randomly connected as a tree.

# For a config node
# c indicates it is a config node
# <id> is a unique decimal integer associated with a node. The value of <id> *MUST* fit in $id_width_lp bits.
# <branch> is a relay node id indicating to which relay node this new config node is connected to.
#          its value should not be greater than or equal to the total number of relay nodes.
#          if 'x' is put in this position, a random relay node is seleted as a branch.
# <name> is a string *WITHOUT* spaces indicating the function of the associated configuration register in the configuration net.
# <data_bits> is a decimal integer specifying the number of bits of the configuration register.
# <default> is a binary string specifying the reset value of the configuration register. The #digits of <default> should be equal to $data_bits.

# The following are example inputs
# r  <id>  <branch>
#r      0
#r      1       0
#r      2       0

#r      4       x

# c  <id>  <branch>   <name>       <data_bits>             <default>
